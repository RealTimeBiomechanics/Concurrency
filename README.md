# Concurrency
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RealTimeBiomechanics/Concurrency.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/RealTimeBiomechanics/Concurrency)

Concurrency is a small library to handle thread synchronization through an efficient C++11 implementation of Queues and Latches.

Some basic examples on how to use Concurrency library are provided in the
[tests](https://github.com/RealTimeBiomechanics/Concurrency/tree/master/tests) folder.

The latest version of the code, together with manuals and terms of use can be found at: https://github.com/RealTimeBiomechanics/Concurrency
